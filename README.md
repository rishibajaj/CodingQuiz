## Usage 

Click the 'Start Quiz' button to view the first question. If you answer correctly, the quiz will move to the next question and you will be awarded five points. For each incorrect quess, 10 seconds will be taken off the timer and the quiz won't move on until the question is answered correctly.

At the end, enter your initials and click submit to view the highscores. If your score is one of the top three highest, then it will be displayed for all to see!

You can also view the highscores by clicking on the link in the top left-hand corner.

NB. As the highscores are only stored in local storage, you will only see the scores from your attempts rather than anyone elses.
